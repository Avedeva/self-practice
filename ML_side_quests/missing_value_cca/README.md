in this file we did the one of many ways to  handle missing value in pour data that is by removing the row also called cca
Remember always check the distribution before and after the droping the rows as the 1st assumption of doing cca is 
the "Mcra" which basically means that the distribution or the empty values are random and shouldn't effect the distribution of the data set
